<h2 id="hello">Welcome to my page!</h2>
<p> I am a penultimate-year PhD student at Imperial College Business School where I am 	<i>very</i> fortunate to be supervised by <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wwiesema/" target="_blank">Wolfram Wiesemann</a> as a member of the Models and Algorithms for Decision-Making under Uncertainty research group. I am also affiliated with the
 	<a href = "https://optimisation.doc.ic.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Computational Optimization Group</a> and the
	<a href = "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/who-we-are/fellows/" target="_blank">Data Science Institute</a> of Imperial College London. I have recently completed a PhD placement at The Alan Turing Institute as a part of the <a href = "https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/aras-selvi" target="_blank">Enrichment Scheme</a> and a PhD AI Research Associate Internship at <a href = "https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/initiatives/synthetic-data" target="_blank">J.P. Morgan</a> (London HQ).</p>


<p> My research interests are at the intersection of robust optimization, machine learning, and computational privacy.
    I am specifically interested in developing efficient algorithms to solve hard optimization problems which arise in privacy, machine learning, and business applications. To this end, in my recent works, I have been working on designing <i>optimal algorithms in differential privacy</i>,
    developing efficient column-and-constraint algorithms for <i>distributionally robust classification</i>, as well as providing tight bounds on <i>convex maximization problems</i> with applications to machine learning.
</p>

<p>
  My work has been recognized by INFORMS Computing Society (winner of the <a href="https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/INFORMS-Computing-Society/ICS-Student-Paper-Award" target="_blank">student paper award</a>), INFORMS Optimization Society (honorable mention for the <a href="https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/Optimization-Society/Optimization-Society-Student-Paper-Prize" target="_blank">student paper prize</a>),
   ICBS (winner of the best analytics PhD student paper award), as well as the President of Imperial College London at the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/leadership-and-strategy/president/writing-and-speeches/presidents-address/inaugural-presidents-address-2022/" target="_blank">President's 2022 Address</a> for external recognition.
   I have received generous grants from NeurIPS (<a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/FinancialAssistance" target = "_blank">scholar award</a>), SIAM (<a href = "https://www.siam.org/conferences/conference-support/siam-student-travel-awards" target="_blank">travel award</a>), G-Research (<a href="https://www.gresearch.com/blog/article/g-research-may-2023-grant-winners/" target="_blank">quantitative PhD grant</a>), and the Sargent Centre (<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/" target="_blank">travel grant</a>).
</p>

<p>
I aspire to combine methodological work with real-life applications. Click <input type=checkbox id="show">

<span id="content"></br>Currently, I am collaborating with a major European nonprofit organization to optimize donation collections.
Throughout my PhD I have had the opportunity to mentor various graduate student-led analytics projects: from improving operational efficiencies and commercial performance for a global energy company (in collaboration with KPMG UK | <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/news/data-spark-means-intelligent-analytics/" target="_blank">link</a>)
to deriving analytical tools to prevent global nuclear proliferation (in collaboration with Chatham House | <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/news/extracting-value-data-imperial-college-data-spark-the-wicked-problem-nuclear-weapons/" target="_blank">link</a>). I competed in the 2019 O.R. & Analytics Student Team Competition as a member of the Tilburg University team and our work on "General Motors: Redefining Vehicle Delivery with Autonomous Cars" has been <a href="https://connect.informs.org/oratc/past-competitions/2019/home2019" target="_blank">one of the 6 finalists out of 292</a> (our optimization-based solution approach is summarized <a href="https://community.aimms.com/academics-using-aimms-49/finalist-team-uses-aimms-for-the-informs-2019-o-r-analytics-student-competition-277?postid=468#post468" target="_blank">here</a>).
